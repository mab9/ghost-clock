Ghost clock always shows you the current time on your desktop background. 

When executing the script, it produces an image of a clock showing the current time. 
As soon ghost clock is installed, a clock image will be generated every minute and set to your desktop background. This makes your desktop spitting.

```

## Explanation of commands 

This command sets the image to the background. the image must be in the /usr/share/backgrounds folder. Otherwise the background change will not work.

    gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri file:///usr/share/backgrounds/clock.jpg

This command does resize the image so that it fits to the display.
    
    gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-options "zoom"

## Cache resources exhausted

When your system falls into cache resources exhausted errors you may increase image magick max memory usage. 

    sudo nano /etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xml
    <policy domain="resource" name="disk" value="1GiB"/>  

**Example: increase memory usage from 1gb to 2gb**
